# Starting a Cluster

Many of the workflows in this repo are designed to take advantage of parallelism 
via `dask`.  Exactly how to start a cluster varies considerably, depending on the
compute platform.  We have boilerplate code to help in starting a suitable cluster
for many of the computing environments where HyTEST workflows are likely to run.
